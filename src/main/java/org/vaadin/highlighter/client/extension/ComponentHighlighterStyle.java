 * {@link CssResource} interface for the component highlighter. This resource

 * {@link #parentOutline()} is set on the extended component's widget itself.
 * This can be used to style the component's widget itself. This style is
 * currently only set on the widget, but its CSS definition is empty. The second
 * style {@link #debugLabel()} will be set on the highlighting label itself. By
 * default, a pink background color is set for this label so that it stands out
 * when rendered in the browser.
